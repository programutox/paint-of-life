# Paint of Life

> Conway's game of life but with colors.

## Principle

This game follows Conway's game of life rules, but it allows you to draw what you want (with several colors) before launching the simulation.

## Why I made this game

On 2021, I programmed Conway's game of life with SFML. It was very verbose and desktop-only, so I decided to renovate it.
Also, I wanted to learn [kaboomjs](kaboomjs.org) in a practical way.

## Setup

You need a static server to use game assets. Type `python3 -m http.server` and follow the link.

If you use uMatrix, you have to allow *unpkg.com* domain, which hosts kaboomjs source code.
